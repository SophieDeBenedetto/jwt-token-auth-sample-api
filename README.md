# JWT Auth Sample App

This project demonstrates one implementation of JWT auth in Rails using the [Knock gem](https://github.com/nsarno/knock). This app is a Rails 5 API that serves data to a seperate Ember application, found [here](https://github.com/SophieDeBenedetto/jwt-token-auth-sample-front).
